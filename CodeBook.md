# Code Book for Analysis R file
## By Miguel Ceballos

1) headers for all variables were red from "features.txt" file
2) Train & Test Set were red as table.
3) colnames were assigned from headers matrix.
4) Train & Test set were joined using rbind.
5) Subjects were loaded from "subject_train.txt" & "subject_test.txt"
6) Subjects names were joined using rbind into allSubjects data set
7) jusMean data set is a subset that collect all mean measurements
8) justSTD data set is a subset that collect all standard deviation measurements
9) allSubjects, justMean and justSTD were joined using cbind into TIDYData data set
10) TIDYData data set was writing out into a file called "tidyData.txt".

## Data Variables
Subject - It represents the number of subject who performed such measurements.
